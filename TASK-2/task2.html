            <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p><span></span>Ravana (/ˈrɑːvənə/; Sanskrit: रावण, IAST: Rāvaṇa, pronounced [ˈraːʋɐɳɐ]) is a multi-headed rakshasa 
                (demon) king of the island of Lanka, and the chief antagonist in the Hindu epic Ramayana. In the Ramayana,
                 Ravana is described as the eldest son of sage Vishrava and rakshasi Kaikesi.</p>

                <div class="bio">
                    <div>
                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>According to Hindu mythology Ravana was born to a great sage Vishrava and his wife, princess Kaikesi.
                             He was born in the Devagana, as his grandfather, the sage Pulastya, was one of the ten Prajapatis or
                              mind-born sons of Brahma and one of the Saptarishi or the Seven Great Sages during the age of Manu.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>ABOUT RAVAN</h4>
                        <p>The soul of Indian mythology is beyond the simple good and evil. If one cares to dig deep, there’s an 
                            interesting story at each and every step. Ravana played the role of a villain, but why did he play this role is 
                            a question of great importance. It was actually to bring an equilibrium to the equation of good and evil.
                             No wonder he is still worshiped in some parts of the world.   Ravana was the grandson of Pulastya, one of the
                              greatest sages of Indian mythology and one of the Saptarishis.  He was born to Sage Vishravan and Asura’s mother 
                              Kaikashi. Hence he is considered half Asur (demon) and half   Brahmin (sage). Ravana is known as the supreme
                               antagonist in the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana. He is depicted   as a Rakshasa (demon) and the great king of Lanka. 
                               He is known as a demon with ten heads, but not many people know that he was not born with ten heads.
                            Ravana actually was a great follower of Lord Shiva, an inordinate scholar, an excellent ruler, and the maestro
                             of the veena (plucked string instrument). He had written two books: the Ravana Samhita (a book of astrology)
                              and Arka Prakasham (book of Siddha medicine). He was well versed in Ayurveda and dark practices of black magic. 
                              It is said that he could control the planetary positions at his will. He owned pushpakviman (a flying chariot)
                               which he won from his step brother Kuber. He had mastered tantra vidya (science of creating optical illusions
                                of thoughts) which he used in battles against his enemies.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4> </h4>
                        <p>The ten heads of Ravana symbolizes the six Shastras (sacred scriptures of Hinduism consisting of four categories: the sruti, 
                            smriti, purana, and tantra) and the four Vedas that Ravana mastered making him a great scholar and one of the most 
                            intelligent beings of those times. He was a master of 64 types of knowledge and all arts of weaponry. He is known to have
                             compiled Veda with the relevant musical svara (notes) and his Shiva Tandava stotra is yet the most popular hymn ever sung 
                             in praise of Lord Shiva.Yet another interpretation of Ravana’s 10 heads are the 10 emotions. Those emotions are:
                              Kaam (lust), Krodh (anger,) Moha (delusion), Lobh (greed), Mada (pride), Maatsarya (envy), Manas (mind), Buddhi (intellect),
                               Chit (will), and Ahamkara (ego). .</p>

                                             He said “ Yo planets, me son is going to take birth, stay in your perfect positions or else
